> **Please note**:  although we currently use this toolkit to create production-ready APIs, the toolkit is still under development.  Use at your own risk.  This doc is under a heavy rewrite.  Information here is mostly correct, but there are gaps and it's messy.



## Introduction

This library is not intended to be used directly (though if you know what you are doing, you could).

Instead, please see [hypermea](https://github.com/pointw-dev/hypermea) for the full toolkit and documentation.
